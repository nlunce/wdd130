            What is
            Sisterhood?
            Through sisterhood we unlearn what we’ve been told about the world... That it’s a harsh place for women,
            where competition and jealousy rule the relationships we have with each
            other. To come out on the other side empowered, supported, and knowing that we’re not alone in this, and
            that
            together we can achieve anything. We are all social animals, and women especially thrive better when we have
            a sense of belonging, and
            community. Stepping into true sisterhood c means that you’re willing to go deep, and to love fully, with all
            that you
            are, visible, vulnerable. It’s a conscious choice that you have to make. Sisterhood is not something that
            happens to you, it’s something that you willfully create.
